Test Plan for Multithreaded Client and Multiprocessed Server Bank System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) First start the client to test if it attempts to connect every 3 seconds until it finds the server.
	

2) Run the server to test successful connection between client and server.


3) Disconnect client from server.


4) Disconnect server, all clients will also be disconnected.


5) Start Server and Client again. Open an account and start an active session with the account. Program will also throttle commands every two seconds.


6) Test credit, debit, balance, and finish commands and make sure the correct messages are displayed.


7) Run another client and open another account. Try to start an active session and get denied. Start a different account.


8) At this point the server should be printing bank info every 20 seconds correctly.


9) We will use the exit command to disconnect from the server.
